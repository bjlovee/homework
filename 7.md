# **1. What are all the JavaScript Data Types?**

## *Null*, *Undefined*, *Boolean*,  *Number*, *BigInt*, *String*, *Symbol*
<br>
<br>

# **2. What is the Difference Between Const Let and Var? Consider Scope ... Give an example**

## *(Const) The scope of a const variable is block scope. It cannot be updated or re-declared into the scope. It cannot be declared without initialization.* 
<br>

## *(Let) The scope of a let variable is block scope. It can be updated but cannot be re-declared into the scope. It can be declared without initialization.*
<br>

## *(Var) The scope of a var variable is functional scope. It can be updated and re-declared into the scope. It can be declared without initialization.*
<br>
<br>

# **3. Pass By Value vs Pass By Reference? Why would you say a String is pass by value/ or a value type? Why is an object a reference type?**

## *The main difference between the two is that passing by value happens when assigning primitives while passing by reference when assigning objects.*
<br>

## *When you assign a string variable to another variable, It actually copies the reference to the object but not the object itself. It means, since the string variable holds the reference to the actual data, so it passes this reference and not the actual data. So, it's pass by value.*
<br>

## *An object variable is always a reference-type. Classes and string are reference type. Struct and enum are kind of value types.*
<br>
<br>

# **4. What do Map , Filter and Reduce do? Do they mutate the array you call them on?**

## *The map() method is used for creating a new array from an existing one, applying a function to each one of the elements of the first array.*
<br>

## *The filter() method takes each element in an array and it applies a conditional statement against it. If this conditional returns true, the element gets pushed to the output array. If the condition returns false, the element does not get pushed to the output array.*
<br>

## *The reduce() method reduces an array of values down to just one value. To get the output value, it runs a reducer function on each element of the array.*
<br>
<br>

# **5. What are all the Falsey Values in JavaScript? Why do you think this is important to know?**

## *false, 0, -0 0n, ""'`, null, undefined, NaN, document.all it*

## *It can help you write cleaner code.*
<br>
<br>

# **6. What are Async and Await?**
## *The keyword await makes JavaScript wait until that promise settles and returns its result.*
<br>
## *The word “async” before a function means one simple thing: a function always returns a promise. Other values are wrapped in a resolved promise automatically.*
<br>
<br>

# **7. What is an async function?**
## *The async function declaration declares an async function where the await keyword is permitted within the function body. The async and await keywords enable asynchronous, promise-based behavior to be written in a cleaner style, avoiding the need to explicitly configure promise chains.*
<br>
<br>

# **8. What are try and catch?**
## *The try statement allows you to define a block of code to be tested for errors while it is being executed. The catch statement allows you to define a block of code to be executed, if an error occurs in the try block. The try and catch keywords come in pairs:*
