# **What is Big O Notation?**

Big O Notation is a tool used to describe the time complexity of algorithms. It calculates the time taken to run an algorithm as the input grows. In other words, it calculates the worst-case time complexity of an algorithm. Big O Notation in Data Structure describes the upper bound of an algorithm's runtime.

 **Big Omega notation (Ω) :**

It is define as lower bound and lower bound on an algorithm is the least amount of time required ( the most efficient way possible, in other words best case).
Just like O notation provide an asymptotic upper bound, Ω notation provides asymptotic lower bound.

**Big Theta notation (Θ) :**

It is define as tightest bound and tightest bound is the best of all the worst case times that the algorithm can take.
Let f(n) define running time of an algorithm. 
f(n) is said to be Θ(g(n)) if f(n) is O(g(n)) and f(n) is Ω(g(n)).
