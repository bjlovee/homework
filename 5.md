The **Vistor** is **requesting Information** by hitting the https route. that request is then send to **node.js/server.js** then it will work with our **controller** which is **Express**. **Express** will then determine what information is needed. For example if its a simple **res.send('hello')** **Express** will send back hello without even needing to go into the **Data Base** or **View Engine**. For the next **example** we will say we have a **Data Base** and a **JSX View Engine**. We will start at **Express** position in the **Diagram**. 
(cont.) **Express** will pull the **requested** information from the **Data Base** and, the **JSX View Engine**. Once the information is gathered **Express** will then send the user back the **requested Information**.
